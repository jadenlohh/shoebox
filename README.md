# Shoebox
A mock up of a ecommerce website done for a school project. It is a CRUD application that allows admins to create, retrive, update and delete products, items and user accounts. Customers can also choose and purchase a item by adding the item to cart and checking out. 

*This application uses NETS API which allows customers to enter their card details to simulate a purchase and SendGrid API to send email<br><br>
